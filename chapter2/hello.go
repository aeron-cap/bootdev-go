CHAPTER 2

if INITIAL_STATEMENT; CONDITION {}
eg.
if length := getLenth(email); length < 10 {}


switch var {
case "condition1":
 	...
case "condition2":
	...
default:
	...
}
break statement is implicit in Go

func NAME(param1 TYPE, param2 TYPE) {}

declaration syntax is a bit different - types are on the right
x int
p *int

variables in  Go are passed by value

ignore return values
x, _ := getValue()

return statement without arguments returns the names return values (naked return)

defers are  a unique feature in  Go, it allows a function to run before
its enclosing function returns
last in first out basis in execution

go is block-scoped meaning everything inside {} is scoped

currying is a concept from functional programming and involces partial application of functions
